# CardMarketPy  
### This program is used for collecting price information of cards for sale on cardmarket.com. Mainly it is designed to collect information about Pokemon cards.the name,edition,price and other information is saved in a csv to have a history of venita values and to be able to apply queries on the data collection.For now the program is intentionally started locally once a day, but the idea is to be able to batch it to make data extraction automatic. All this done since cardmarket only allows API use if registered as a store on their site. All the code above here is as a study function and no special requests are applied towards the site,nor is any malicious code used, as the information on the site is public with no access rule or personal token.
